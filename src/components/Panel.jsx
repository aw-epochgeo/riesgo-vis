            On September 26, 2009, tropical storm “Ondoy” (typhoon “Ketsana”) made landfall and for 12 hours, flooded Metro Manila and Central Luzon. Catching everyone by surprise, it continuously dumped around 341 mm (14 in) of rain in just 6 hours and within 24 hours, a record-high 455 mm (17.9 in) of rainfall was reported. In its aftermath, around 464 people drowned and 11 billion pesos worth of infrastructure and agriculture were damaged (<i>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Ketsana" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/818907/special-report-on-storm-ondoy-marikina-remembers-end-of-the-world" target="_blank">Inquirer</a></i>).

            Completely unaware, many families in low lying areas were stranded in their upper floors while others climbed to their roofs. In Marikina, around 14 to 23 available schools and evacuation centers took people in, as well as some churches. While many scrambled to these locations as it rained, there were anecdotal reports that some of these experienced flooding as well. As we prepare for more typhoons and monsoon rains like those brought by Ondoy, <span class="highlight">how suitable are the current evacuation centers and their locations in sheltering Marikina’s citizens from peril?</span>
          </Typography>
          <br></br>
          <Typography>
            First, let’s look at what the current evacuation centers are like. Like most cities in the Philippines, Marikina converts its elementary schools, high schools and covered basketball courts into temporary shelters during typhoons.

          <Typography>
            While these buildings might seem practical for a few days of stay, there are always concerns whether there is <span class="highlight">enough space and provisions for privacy, proper sanitation and healthcare</span>. This is especially true for evacuees who cannot easily return to their homes and would require further recovery assistance.

          <Typography variant="h6">HAZARD EXPOSURE</Typography>
          <Typography>
            Twelve evacuation centers are located in medium to high hazard areas for a 5-year flood return period, almost a third of their number. This jumps to 21 evacuation centers for a 100-year return period, fifteen of which are schools. While many of these schools are multi-storey buildings with at least 3-4 floors, evacuees in these shelters can still get stranded and make them unable to access other critical facilities nearby.

            If we look at the flood hazard for a 5-year return period, around <span class="highlight">47% of the population are exposed to high and medium hazards</span>, which is already a sizeable number of people. This percentage jumps to <span class="highlight">65%</span> and <span class="highlight">69%</span> of the population for the 25- and 100-year return periods, respectively.

            If we draw <span class="highlight">400 m</span> circles around each evacuation center, the map shows how many people can reach them within an acceptable walking distance. What do these mean? We can consider these as the <span class="highlight">ideal number of people that each evacuation center should be able to shelter</span> in times of disaster. Currently, <span class="highlight">86%</span> of the population are in close proximity to at least one evacuation center.

            There are also many evacuation centers that <span class="highlight">overlap ideal coverage</span>, which can be a good thing for citizens. There are around <span class="highlight">35%</span> of the population with at least two evacuation centers nearby, and <span class="highlight">3% of them are near to four shelters</span>. And if we look at the map, these clusters of evacuation centers are nicely located in relatively population dense areas, suggesting good coverage and availability of options.

            Now that we know the ideal number of people that each evacuation center should serve, <span class="highlight">how many can they actually fit?</span> We got the total floor areas and computed for the estimated number of people that can comfortably stay in these shelters (<span class="highlight">5 sqm of space per person</span>). All locations had an estimated capacity <span class="highlight">way below their ideal coverage</span>, which means there won’t be enough space if everyone within close proximity have to evacuate. On average, there is a sizeable difference of around <span class="highlight">10,416 people</span> that will be underserved per evacuation center.

            To illustrate some of these differences, here is <span class="highlight">Sampaguita Gym</span> with an estimated capacity of only <span class="highlight">123 people</span> evacuating and staying comfortably within its vicinity. However, because of the dense population within close proximity, it needs to serve <span class="highlight">168 times more people</span>.

            We also looked into the accessibility of the evacuation centers by generating isochrones that represent <span class="highlight">areas that can be reached from 5 to 30 minutes</span>. It can be seen from the map that all evacuation centers can already be reached by the majority of the population in <span class="highlight">15 minutes</span>, which is beneficial for urgent evacuations at the onset of a heavy downpour. However, these isochrones cannot account for the effects of flooding on one’s walking speed if evacuations will happen during a deluge.

          <Typography>
            By considering the various factors such as <span class="highlight">flood hazard level, land elevation, land cover, accessibility to road networks and the maximum population coverage of an evacuation center</span>, we derived a suitability score for each area. The suitability score gives us an idea of how ideal a certain area is for an evacuation center to be built to be able to minimize the risks.
          </Typography>
          <br></br>
          <Typography>
            The basis of the suitability score varied depending on the flood hazard level to be able to factor in cases of high-rising flood and low-rising flood. If we look at the suitability map for a 5-year return period, <span class="highlight">over 52% of the city has low to very low suitability</span>. The percentage increases to approximately <span class="highlight">64%</span> and <span class="highlight">69%</span> for the 25- and 100-year return periods respectively.

          <br></br>
          <Typography>
            Out of the 28 evacuation centers, <span class="highlight">only 3 evacuation centers</span> will be in very high suitability areas up until the 100-year return period. There are 13 which would stay in high suitability areas, but the remaining 12 will be in low suitability areas by the 100-year return period.

            Despite a large area of Marikina considered to have low suitability for flood evacuation centers, there are some large <span class="highlight">very high suitable areas</span> that we can notice. The largest area is found in the neighborhood of <span class="highlight">Marikina Heights</span> at the eastern side of the city. This area is composed of mountains and numerous narrow alleys which act as <span class="highlight">catch basins</span> during the floods. In the recent flooding due to Typhoon Karding, this area reported no flooding possibly due to its <span class="highlight">topographical characteristics</span> and <span class="highlight">developed facilities</span> like drainage and pumping stations to accommodate the <span class="highlight">high population</span>.
          </Typography>
          <br></br>
          <Typography>
            The second largest very high suitable area is found at the western side of the Marikina River with <span class="highlight">Ateneo De Manila University</span> as a neighbor on the west. The university area is <span class="highlight">almost entirely covered in grass with some scattered trees</span>. Compared to other areas <span class="highlight">right beside the river</span>, this area has a <span class="highlight">higher elevation</span> and experiences <span class="highlight">very little flooding</span>.
          </Typography>
          <br></br>
          <Typography>
            On the other side of the Marikina River, another very high suitable area can be observed and it is <span class="highlight">relatively closer to the river</span> compared to the previous area mentioned. Aside from its relatively <span class="highlight">large concentration of people</span>, the high suitability score could be attributed to <span class="highlight">numerous passable roads</span> and spots of <span class="highlight">greenery</span> contributed by golf lots, sports complexes and other leisure accommodations within the vicinity.

          <Typography>
            In this analysis of Marikina's evacuation centers, we have illustrated how unsuitable many of them are in terms of their <span class="highlight">medium to high exposure to flooding</span> and <span class="highlight">incapacity to serve nearby residents</span>. We then tried to look into the suitability of other areas, hoping to find <span class="highlight">viable locations for new evacuation centers</span>. We found Marikina Heights as the most viable location for evacuation centers. But anything built there cannot serve other densely populated areas. 
          </Typography>
          <br></br>
          <Typography>
            What about other suitable locations that are already built up land? There is always the option of finding existing buildings other than schools and covered courts that can also serve as shelters. However, we highly suggest that Marikina explore <span class="highlight">developing multipurpose buildings</span> like those built in Singapore to account for the lack of space in many residential areas. 
          </Typography>
          <br></br>
          <Typography> 
            While Marikina can be lauded in the herculean task of effectively instituting information campaigns and building flood control infrastructures, it is also important that they look into critical infrastructures that are heavily utilized at the onset, during and soon after a typhoon or flooding. Although these are temporary relief, evacuees' experiences in these shelters will definitely set the tone for their successful return and recovery.
